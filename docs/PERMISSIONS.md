# üß© Permissions & Access Control

This document defines how permissions work in the system and how access is propagated across **Boards**, **Categories**, and **Groups**.
It serves as a reference for developers, designers, and anyone implementing or reasoning about access rules.

---

## üìö Overview

Access in the system is **hierarchical** and **contextual**.
Every resource, a **Board**, **Category**, or **Group**, can have roles assigned to users that determine what they can see or do.

Permissions are organized from most specific (Board) to broadest (Group ‚Üí Global).

## üß† Permission Rules

### 1. Visibility (Downward Access)

If a user has a role on a resource:

- They can **see that resource**.
- If it‚Äôs a **Category** or **Group**, they can also **see all of its children** (recursively).

### 2. Upward Inheritance

If a user has access to a resource:

- **Board ‚Üí Category**: A board-level user inherits equivalent visibility/access to its parent category.
- **Category ‚Üí Group**: A category-level user inherits equivalent visibility/access to its parent group.
- Inherited access is **only for visibility/navigation**, not for managing or modifying the parent.

### 3. Fetching Rules

When fetching resources:

- **Boards**: Only include boards the user has access to (directly or through a category/group).
- **Categories**: Only include categories the user has access to (directly or through a group).
- **Groups**: Only include groups the user has access to.
- **Developers**: See everything, unfiltered.
